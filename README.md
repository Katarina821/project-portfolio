# Portfolio
Assigment: Start building portfolio for projects and testing code for accessibilty using a checklist

## The problem
I had several problems during the accessibilty testing, mainly with the coclorscheme and also with the set up and structure with the links. I used tab-index to make the page more accessible using keybord.
The code is tested with: https://wave.webaim.org/ , https://tenon.io/ and https://validator.w3.org/ ,
